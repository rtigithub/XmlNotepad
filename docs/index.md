XML Notepad is the result of a promise Chris Lovett made to a friend at Microsoft. The original XML
Notepad shipped in back in 1998, written by Murray Low in C++. Later on it fell behind in support
for XML standards and, because we didn't have time to fix it, we pulled the downloader. But Murray
apparently did such a nice job that MSDN was inundated with requests to put the notepad back up, so
they asked for a replacement.

Chris was working on System.Xml in C# in 1999, so he figured he could crank out a replacement using
the .NET Framework pretty quickly. Well, the problem was it was one of those side projects on his
"one-day" list â€” you know how that goes! Fortunately, another good friend, Michael Corning, took
interest in it, helped hold his feet to the fire, and also added some cool features himself. Dan
Doris also took pity on Chris and helped identify some great bugs. So here we are, a nifty tool that
should be useful to those who want a quick way to view and edit XML documents.

There have been over 3 million downloads since then - so thanks to everyone who tried it out!  

### Handy features include:

- Ability to load .csv and .htm files converting them to XML.
- Tree View synchronized with Node Text View for quick editing of node names and values.
